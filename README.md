# Dress_dataset_practice_set_2
This data set is 2nd practice data set for iNeuron data analysis course. With this data set I learned how to insert bulk data set into mysql automaticlly. In previous data set we inserted all the data manually. But with this dataset we learned inserting bulk data automatically, constrains: auto-increment, default, not null,  check etc. we learned why we need a primary key, how to alter table etc.
